## Flash Loans

## 1. Concept
A flash loan lets you borrow assets without collateral, as long as you return them within the same transaction. If you fail to return them, the entire transaction reverts as if it never happened.

## 2. Key Points
* Reversion makes the loan "risk-free" for the lender.
* Uncollateralized, atomic, instant loans.
* Either repay borrowed amount, with fee or transaction auto reverts.
* Profit is made from the repayment fees included with borrowed amount.
* All actions in the txn must succeed or none do, thats Atomicity.
* No collateral because the blockchain's atomic model acts as collateral.
* Borrow huge sums for less risk, since everything is in a txn.
* The why is to turn time into temporary leverage.
* Borrower only profits if the whole sequence succeeds.
* Maximize capital efficiency and enable complex DeFi actions.
